We are a community of programmers, hackers and engineers from Ukraine that aim to gain and share knowledge together. Also, we dislike forks. 

## What we do
Since September of 2019 we are continuously learning and practicing Computer Science. Topics range from assembly language to modern cryptography, from playing CTFs to doing competitive programming. Full list can be found [here](./topics.html).
